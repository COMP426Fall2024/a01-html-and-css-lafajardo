        <h3>Summary provided by Britannica:</h3>
        <p>Pandora, in Greek mythology, the first woman. According to Hesiod’s Theogony, after Prometheus, a fire god and divine
            trickster, had stolen fire from heaven and bestowed it upon mortals, Zeus, the king of the gods, determined to counteract
            this blessing. He accordingly commissioned Hephaestus (a god of fire and patron of craftsmen) to fashion a woman out of
            earth, upon whom the gods bestowed their choicest gifts. In Hesiod’s Works and Days, Pandora had a jar containing all
            manner of misery and evil. Zeus sent her to Epimetheus, who forgot the warning of his brother Prometheus and made
            Pandora his wife. She afterward opened the jar, from which the evils flew out over the earth. Hope alone remained inside,
            the lid having been shut down before she could escape. In a later story the jar contained not evils but blessings, which
            would have been preserved for the human race had they not been lost through the opening of the jar out of curiosity.
            Pandora’s jar became a box in the 16th century, when the Renaissance humanist Erasmus either mistranslated the Greek
            or confused the vessel with the box in the story of Cupid and Psyche.
