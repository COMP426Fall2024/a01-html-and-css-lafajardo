        <h3>Story Translated:</h3>
        <p>Then Zeus who gathers clouds addressed him angrily,
            “You, Iapetos’ Son [1] ,knowing cunning more than all,
            with glee you stole the fire and deceived my mind;
            for you will be great sorrow, and for future men.
            As fire’s price I’ll give an evil thing, which all
            shall cherish in their hearts, embracing their own scourge.”
            
            Thus spoke the sire of gods and men, and laughed aloud.
            He bade Hephaistos, well-renowned, to wet the earth
            with water speedily, to add both human voice
            and strength, to make a face like deathless goddesses’,
            a maiden’s lovely, charming shape; Athena was
            to teach the crafts and weaving on the well-wrought loom;
            and Aphrodite was to bathe her head with grace
            and difficult desire and limb-fatiguing care;
            to add a dog-like, shameless mind and thieving ways
            he charged to Hermes Argeiphontes [2].
            
            He spoke, and they obeyed Lord Zeus, the Son of Kronos.
            Forthwith from earth the famous Doubly-lame One [3] formed
            a modest maiden’s shape, as Kronos’ Son had planned;
            Bright-eyed [4] Athene then arrayed and girded her;
            The goddess Graces and august Persuasion put
            the golden necklaces upon her skin; and then
            the fair-tressed Hours crowned her head with spring-time flowers;
            Athene draped her frame with every ornament.
            The Argos-slaying guide implanted in her breast
            deceits and wheedling words, the habits of a thief,
            according to loud-thundering Zeus’s plans. And speech
            the herald of the gods put in, and named the maid
            Pandora [5], since all those who hold Olympian homes
            had given gifts to her, sorrows for hard-working men.
            
            But when the sire had made the hopeless, towering trap,
            he sent the Argus-slaying, famed swift messenger
            of gods to bring the gift to Epimetheus, who
            forgot Prometheus told him to accept no gift
            from Zeus Olympian, but to send it back in case
            it be, perhaps, some evil thing for mortal men.
            But when he took and kept the scourge, he understood.
            
            At first the tribes of men had lived upon the earth
            apart and free of evils and of tiresome toil
            and hard diseases, which have brought to men their dooms [6], because by hardship mortal men are quickly aged.
            But with her hands the woman raised the jar’s great lid,
            released all these, devising [7] grievous cares for men.
            Alone there, Elpis [8], in her indestructible home,
            remained within, beneath the lip, nor by the door
            escaped, because the vessel’s lid had stopped her first,
            by will of aegis-bearing, cloud-compelling Zeus.
            Among the people wander countless miseries;
            the earth is full of evils, and the sea is full;
            diseases come by day to people, and by night,
            spontaneous, rushing, bringing mortals evil things
            in silence, since contriving Zeus removed their voice.
            And thus from Zeus’s mind there can be no escape.
                        
        </p>
